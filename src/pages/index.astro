        Untitled company was founded by Employer Employer himself,
        <b>Tudyslaier</b>, on a rigurous interviewing process<sup

        even more skillful actually get hired.

      <h2>The Obeya <span class="obeya-addon">(Â§ßÈÉ®Â±ã)</span></h2>

      <p>
        The Obeya is where most of this company's work happens. It is where the
        harpers harp, where the minstrels sing, and where the trumpets ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words, so far, the Obeya is a Discord call in which all of our
        work is done. Be it alone work, game jams or even Letters Leagues, we
        are always mentaly in the Obeya.

      <h2>This Website</h2>
      <p>
        This website is our attempt at bridging the gap between us, the Obeya
        and <i>the Public<sup>TM</sup></i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, it is an absolute piece of üóëÔ∏è, but we are actively working
        towards fixing it and making it ... any good. The reasons for this are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Items do not fit in</li>
        <li>We, oursevles, are unsure of what we want this website to be</li>
